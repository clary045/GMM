This project is using Gaussian Mixture Model to detect orange and apple and sorting them to their respective boxes.
It contains the following python file.
1. Data collection using Matlab
2. detect Orange function 
3. detect apple function
4. Implementation in real time

Requirements:
The GMM algorithm uses the following python package:
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. scipy
4. Open cv
5. For dataset you can create your own. The minimum should be atleast 50 image for each class.
